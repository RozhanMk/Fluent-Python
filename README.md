# Fluent-Python

Fluent Python is an intermediate-level book that explores important features and concepts of the Python language. I recommend it to anyone who already knows basic Python and object-oriented programming. This book will level up your understanding in ways you might not anticipate.

Although it’s a heavy book (approximately 1,100 pages). Be patient, and try to apply its techniques in your own code.

I’ve found that summarizing each chapter helps me identify my weaknesses and also helps me review and refresh my memory later. Feel free to use these notebooks!
